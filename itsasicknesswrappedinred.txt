Rival & Jex - For You
//-----//
You, oh you
I couldn't choose if I wanted to
Choose to get over you
Broke, broke in two
I couldn't leave if I wanted to
I'm still amused

It's a sickness, wrapped in red
You're the monster underneath my bed
It's a heartache, left unsaid
You're the hottest flame, the deepest dread

But I would wait for you
(If it's what you wanted, you wanted, you wanted)
And I would go and lose my mind

It's a sickness, wrapped in red
But I would do it all again
It's a heartache, left unsaid
But I would do it all again for you

You, oh you
You watch me lose 'causе I fall for you
I'd lose it all for you
Heart's black and blue
You watch me break right in front of you
Lovin' the view

It's a sickness, wrapped in red
You're the monster underneath my bed
It's a heartache, left unsaid
You're the hottest flame, the deepest dread

But I would wait for you
(If it's what you wanted, you wanted, you wanted)
And I would go and lose my mind

It's a sickness, wrapped in red
But I would do it all again (Do it all again)
It's a heartache, left unsaid
But I would do it all again for you

You, oh you
I couldn't choose if I wanted to
Choose to get over you
Broke, broke in two
I couldn't leave if I wanted to
I'm still amused
