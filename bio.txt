Only Tenshi is allowed here. If you're not, I don't even know why are you here so please get out of the middle. This is a case between me, him and nobody else.


































I'm once again telling - If you're not Tenshi, get out already.











































Okay so, you know I have never claimed myself right. And I will never already. I have always been, am always and will always be the wrong side. I learn because you teach me. I learn because you correct me. Think about it or not - I'm always wrong just as how I used to be. I'm the same Bedirhan. Didn't change. Just keep that in mind and reconsider.
